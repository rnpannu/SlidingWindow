# SlidingWindow
Class design: For our class design, we made a base SlidingWindow class, and then created Sender and Receiver subclasses that inherit fumctionality from the base class. As the project grows and we start transmitting data, the sender and Receiver subclasses will start to gain more specialized functionality themselves.

Test cases: We took into account our various conditions and outcomes for each method and ensured that we had tests to check each of our return values.

Build test cases: Open the project folder in the terminal. Write commands make clean, make, and run the test executable to see the test cases run.
